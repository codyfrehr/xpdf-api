There is no need to "install" anything from this package.  You can
unpack the tar file and run the binaries directly from there.

Man pages are available in the 'doc' subdirectory.  They can be read
with, e.g., 'man doc/pdftotext.1'.

The 'doc/sample-xpdfrc' file can be used as a template for ~/.xpdfrc.
This configuration file is completely optional.
