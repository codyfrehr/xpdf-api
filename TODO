- should make use of the term "RICH text" or "rich PDF" in your javadocs and readme, and make a special note about how this only works on PDF files with RICH TEXT
- test all code examples from readme and javadocs to ensure they are working!
- figure out how to get github pipeline to run 32-bit architecture (might need to use docker containers...)
- setup coverage check in pipeline + add badge
- set up github issue management and security management
- explore and update other general settings for the repo
- figure out process to deploy to maven central repo
  - take into consideration repos which provide download statistics: https://blog.sonatype.com/2010/12/now-available-central-download-statistics-for-oss-projects/
  - guide: https://maven.apache.org/repository/guide-central-repository-upload.html
    - requirements (link from within page above) https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/
      verify all key metadata has been added to poms (ie lombok has <issue management>, <developers>, etc)
  - figure out maven-release-plugin, to control versioning and release process to maven central
    a good starting point for this would be to find a popular/respected open-source repo using pom configs, and see if they have maven release plugin configured, and how they do it.
- add badge to readme for maven artifact https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons-lang3/3.14.0/jar?eh=
- add badge for javadocs https://javadoc.io/
- request derek to add link to your library on their webpage
- build really basic homepage for website, resembling layout of https://kotest.io/docs or even just the simpler https://mockk.io/, or like that license plugin page
- add dependabot to repo for automatic security updates? not sure how i feel about auto updates...
  at very least, make sure notifications set up for failing pipeline security tests.
  and make sure repo security well configured, and snyk configured as well as possible (login to snyk website for additional configs)
- fix broken github links on resume and website
- reorganize SCRIBBLES into official supporting documents
  - write CONTRIBUTING (is this standard name for developer instructions to contribute? DEVELOPERS seems like a better name for file maybe?)
  - what other files?
