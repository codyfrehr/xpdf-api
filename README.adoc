= Xpdf API
TODO: automatically inject build status, like spring boot project does
TODO: look at other readme with .adoc structure, and see what other ways there are to format this. for example, spring boot has tabs for "Security" and "Code of Conduct" - pretty cool!
:toc:

Xpdf API is a collection of Java APIs for https://www.xpdfreader.com/about.html[Xpdf], an open source library for working with PDF files written in C++.
Xpdf is an invaluable PDF toolkit, and this project aims to make it more accessible to the Java community.

Our primary goals are:

* Provide full programmatic access to Xpdf.
* Act as a pure, unobscured interface to Xpdf.

APIs are available for the following Xpdf functions (with more to come):

* _pdftotext_ - convert PDF files to text

== Getting Started

=== Requirements

* JDK 8 or later
* Windows, Linux, or Mac OS

=== Dependencies
TODO: automatically inject maven central references with latest versions
TODO: is there a way to provide a code block with tabs, so users can choose between all dependencies in single block?

=== PdfTextTool API
TODO: do we want image in source code? or should we host on website, and link to that?

*Important:* We provide a couple usages of this tool below, but we highly recommend downloading sources in your IDE so that you have full access to our JavaDocs.
We made an extra effort to provide you with all the help you need, directly from your editor.

*Simple Example:*

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    // initialize the tool
    PdfTextTool pdfTextTool = PdfTextTool.builder().build();

    // build a request with a PDF file
    PdfTextRequest request = PdfTextRequest.builder()
            .pdfFile(new File("C:/docs/some.pdf"))
            .build();

    // convert the PDF into a text file
    PdfTextResponse response = pdfTextTool.process(request);
----

*Complex Example:*
[source,java,indent=0]
----
    PdfTextTool pdfTextTool = PdfTextTool.builder().build();

    // add some options to customize your request
    PdfTextOptions options = PdfTextOptions.builder()
            .format(PdfTextFormat.TABLE)
            .encoding(PdfTextEncoding.UTF_8)
            .ownerPassword("Secret123")
            .nativeOptions(Map.ofEntries(Map.entry("-cfg", "C:/config/xpdfrc")))
            .build();

    // build a request with options, and specify an output text file
    PdfTextRequest request = PdfTextRequest.builder()
            .pdfFile(new File("C:/docs/some.pdf"))
            .textFile(new File("C:/docs/some.txt"))
            .options(options)
            .build();

    PdfTextResponse response = pdfTextTool.process(request);

== How It Works [[how_it_works]]
TODO

If you understand how to use Xpdf, then you should understand how Xpdf API works.

== Configuration
TODO

*Important:* Before proceeding, you should read <<how_it_works, How It Works>> because understanding what happens under the hood is essential to understanding how it can be customized.

== Building From Source

You do not need to build this project locally to use Xpdf API (packages are available in the Maven Central Repository).

But if you wish to build anyway, all you need is JDK 8 and our provided Maven wrapper.
