Xpdf API is a collection of Java APIs for https://www.xpdfreader.com/about.html[Xpdf], the open source library for operating on PDF files written in C++.
Xpdf is an invaluable PDF toolkit, and this project aims to make it more accessible to the Java community.

Our primary goals are:

* Provide full programmatic access to Xpdf.
* Act as a pure, unobscured interface to Xpdf.

APIs are available for the following Xpdf functions (with more to come):

* _pdftotext_ - convert PDF files to text

== Getting Started

=== Requirements

* JDK 8 or later
* Windows, Linux, or Mac OS

=== Dependencies
//TODO: automatically inject maven central references with latest versions
//TODO: is there a way to provide a code block with tabs, so users can choose between all dependencies in single block?

== PdfText API

We strongly recommend downloading sources in your IDE so that you have full access to our JavaDocs.
We made an extra effort to provide you with all the help you need, directly from your editor.

We also strongly encourage you to read the _pdftotext_ source documentation for a complete overview of the tool and the options available to customize its execution.
//TODO: link to docs in repo..?
Documentation can be found alongside the executable file in the package resources.

=== Examples

__Just convert my PDF file into a text file - who cares how it's configured!__

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    // initialize the tool
    PdfTextTool pdfTextTool = PdfTextTool.builder().build();

    // build a request with a PDF file
    PdfTextRequest request = PdfTextRequest.builder()
            .pdfFile(new File("~/docs/some.pdf"))
            .build();

    // convert the PDF into a text file
    PdfTextResponse response = pdfTextTool.process(request);
----

__Convert my PDF file into a text file, but let me customize it - I care about the data!__

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    PdfTextTool pdfTextTool = PdfTextTool.builder().build();

    // add some options to customize your request
    PdfTextOptions options = PdfTextOptions.builder()
            .format(PdfTextFormat.TABLE)
            .encoding(PdfTextEncoding.UTF_8)
            .ownerPassword("Secret123")
            .nativeOptions(Map.ofEntries(Map.entry("-cfg", "~/configs/xpdfrc")))
            .build();

    // build a request with options, and specify an output text file
    PdfTextRequest request = PdfTextRequest.builder()
            .pdfFile(new File("~/docs/some.pdf"))
            .textFile(new File("~/docs/some.txt"))
            .options(options)
            .build();

    PdfTextResponse response = pdfTextTool.process(request);

=== PdfTextTool

`PdfTextTool` represents the Xpdf _pdftotext_ command line tool.
It is a simple service that allows you to programmatically execute shell commands against _pdftotext_, which is included with this project in an executable format for Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems.

Default configuration of `PdfTextTool` is to use the executable provided in the package resources, with a 30 second timeout on individual invocations.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    PdfTextTool.builder().build();
----

If you want to use your own installation of _pdftotext_, then you can download it from Xpdf https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html[here].
Timeout can also be configured, but unless you are working with truly massive PDF files, most executions happen in under a second.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    PdfTextTool.builder()
            .executableFile(new File("~/libs/pdftotext"))
            .timeoutSeconds(60)
            .build();
----

If you are using our Spring Boot starter, then use the following properties to configure the `PdfTextTool` bean.

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
io.xpdf.api.pdftext:
      executable-path: "~/libs/pdftotext"
      timeout-seconds: 60
----

=== PdfTextRequest

`PdfTextRequest` represents an individual shell command to invoke _pdftotext_.

A shell command to invoke _pdftotext_ requires an input PDF file and an output text file.
Here is a side-by-side comparison of a `PdfTextRequest` and the corresponding shell command it represents.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    PdfTextRequest.builder()
            .pdfFile(new File("~/docs/some.pdf"))
            .textFile(new File("~/docs/some.txt"))
            .build();
----

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
  $ pdftotext "~/docs/some.pdf" "~/docs/some.txt"
----

If you only care about the output text and not necessarily the text file itself, then you may exclude this field from your `PdfTextRequest`.
A text file will be automatically initialized for you in your Java temp directory and deleted when your JVM terminates.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    PdfTextRequest.builder()
            .pdfFile(new File("~/docs/some.pdf"))
            .build();
----

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
  $ pdftotext "~/docs/some.pdf" "/tmp/03cb3e01-f281-4cd1-8ae3-210ae6076afa.txt"
----

=== PdfTextOptions

`PdfTextOptions` represents a set of command options accepted by _pdftotext_ that will customize its execution.

Suppose you have a PDF file that is UTF-8 encoded and has tabulated data.
Encoding is something you should definitely tell _pdftotext_ about.
How the output text should be laid out for you is more of an opinionated matter, however.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    PdfTextOptions options = PdfTextOptions.builder()
            .encoding(PdfTextEncoding.UTF_8)
            .format(PdfTextFormat.TABLE)
            .build();

    PdfTextRequest request = PdfTextRequest.builder()
            .pdfFile(new File("~/docs/some.pdf"))
            .textFile(new File("~/docs/some.txt"))
            .options(options)
            .build();
----

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
  $ pdftotext -enc "UTF-8" -table "~/docs/some.pdf" "~/docs/some.txt"
----

We provide a mechanism for you to manually inject options into a command.
We have implemented many (but not all) of the options specified in the _pdftotext_ source documentation, so this is helpful for including options not implemented by `PdfTextOptions`.
But you can do this for any option, implemented or unimplemented.

*Important:* No validation is performed on options entered this way - they will be injected directly into the shell command, as is.
Also be aware that you may inadvertently duplicate an option in the shell command if you both manually inject it and assign a value to the `PdfTextOptions` implementation of that option.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    PdfTextOptions.builder()
            .pageStart(1)
            .pageStop(5)
            .nativeOptions(Map.ofEntries(
                    Map.entry("-enc", "UTF-8"),
                    Map.entry("-table", null),
                    Map.entry("-opw", "Secret123")))
            .build();
----

[source,bash,indent=0]
----
  $ pdftotext -f "1" -l "5" -enc "UTF-8" -table -opw "Secret123" "~/docs/some.pdf" "~/docs/some.txt"
----

=== PdfTextResponse

`PdfTextResponse` represents the result of invoking _pdftotext_.

It will include the text file created from a PDF, as well as any standard output that may have been captured from the shell process.

=== Logging and Debugging

We have added an SLF4J logger to our `PdfTextTool`, leaving its implementation up to you.

We provide meaningful debug logs for those needing such details. If you want the trace from _pdftotext_ itself, then inject the "-verbose" command option into `PdfTextOptions` and inspect the standard output on your `PdfTextResponse`.

== Building from Source

You do not need to build this project locally to use Xpdf API (packages are available in the Maven Central Repository).

But if you wish to build anyway, all you need is JDK 8 and our provided Maven wrapper.
